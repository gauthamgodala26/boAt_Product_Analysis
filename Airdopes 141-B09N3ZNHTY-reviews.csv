"R2JJR4S8BPPGM","Best watch fire boltt watch","‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ (4.5/5) ‚Äì Excellent Value for Money!

I‚Äôve been using the boAt Airdopes 141 Gen 2 for a while now, and I must say, I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with the performance at this price point.

üîä Sound Quality: The audio is crisp and well-balanced with decent bass. Whether it‚Äôs music, calls, or YouTube videos, the sound output is clear and immersive. For casual listening, it's perfect.

üéß Comfort & Fit: The earbuds fit snugly in the ear and are super lightweight. Even after long hours of use, I don‚Äôt feel any discomfort. Great for travel or daily use.

üîã Battery Life: One of the biggest highlights! The battery backup is amazing ‚Äì easily gives me 40+ hours with the charging case. I can go days without worrying about charging.

üéô Mic & Call Quality: The ENx tech really makes a difference. Call quality is quite clear even in noisy surroundings. My voice comes through clean on the other side.

‚ö°Ô∏è Fast Charging: A quick 10-minute charge gives around 75 minutes of playtime ‚Äì a big plus when you're in a hurry!

üîó Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3 gives instant pairing and a stable connection. No audio lag noticed while watching videos or during casual gaming.

üéÆ Low Latency Mode: Perfect for gaming or watching videos, the low latency mode actually reduces delay and keeps everything in sync.

---

Final Verdict:
If you‚Äôre looking for budget-friendly yet feature-rich earbuds, boAt Airdopes 141 Gen 2 is a fantastic choice. Great audio, long battery life, and reliable performance ‚Äì definitely worth itt!!","Reviewed in India on 5 August 2025","Worth it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nT9BP5OzL.jpg

"R25C2665SGA4HY","Old Monk","This is the second time I'm purchasing this item due to its affordable price.

The sound quality is clear and impressive.
The bass is decent, although slightly weaker compared to other Boat products in the same price range.

Bluetooth connectivity is slower than my previous device.

After usage of 1 month: Additionally, the microphone seems to be deteriorating over time‚Äîpeople are increasingly unable to hear my voice clearly during calls.

"R3W0SSPX4CND7D","Nikhil","3 stars because 1. The cost is affordable 2. Audio quality when listening to music at this price is acceptable . 3. Fits very well in the ear .

2 stars removed: 1. The material is plastic and feels very cheap in your hand . 2. Audio quality when on calls is incredible bad . There is a lot of noise surrounding the audio .

Extra points: It can only connect to 1 device at a time . When its connected to a device and you try to connect to another device without realizing the 1st one . you will get no error or indication about it . Just continuously fails to connect . The startup sound of the device is quite bad . Hate the ads on the BOAT app but i suppose thats how they make the money . Is it worth 1499 , sure , if your expectation is low and all you need is a pair of ear phones with basic features working .","Reviewed in India on 26 August 2025","Plastic feel , Music audio Good .

"R358NYWUQLR163","Dillip","Pros:
1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.
2. Awesome Bass!
3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.
4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.
5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.
6. Affordable!
7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.
8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.
9. Type C port

Cons:
1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.
2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]
3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC
4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.

Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with them
Highly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.","Reviewed in India on 2 January 2023","great product under low price range","4.0 out of 5 stars","","528","Bold Black"
"R3MS445R3KAXO9","Tushar","Review: After 1 Year of Using These Earbuds

I‚Äôve been using these earbuds for the past 1 year, and initially, they performed really well. The sound quality was good for the price, the fit was comfortable, and the battery life was decent for daily use. I used them regularly for music, calls, and sometimes even workouts, and they held up pretty well for most of the time.

However, after around 11-12 months, I started noticing some issues. One side began to show charging problems ‚Äî sometimes it wouldn't charge properly or disconnect randomly during use. There's also been some fluctuation in the sound from one earbud, which can be really frustrating, especially during calls or when listening to music.

Overall, the earbuds served me well for a year, but the durability could definitely be better. For short-term use, they‚Äôre okay, but if you're looking for something that lasts longer without problems, you might want to explore other options.....","Reviewed in India on 4 June 2025","Review after. 1 yrar","3.0 out of 5 stars","","12","Bold Black"

"RAO4BESDT66J9","Rahul S","From design to performance, everything feels polished. The sound is immersive, especially the bass it hits hard without overpowering the mids or highs. What I really liked is the call quality thanks to the dual mics and ENx tech, people hear me clearly even outdoors. The fit is snug and comfortable, no ear fatigue even after hours. Battery life is amazing; I charge it once and forget about it for days. The glass-look case is stylish, though I wish the lid felt a bit sturdier. Also, I faced a minor issue once where one earbud didn‚Äôt connect, but re-pairing solved it. Overall, a solid all rounder.","Reviewed in India on 2 July 2025","Good battery backup and stylish colour","5.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Green"

"R22WOFP8B2GD4Z","Vaishnav","Its been approximately 3 months since I've purchased these earbuds, and i use them for atleast 3 hours every single day, and even upto 6 hours sometimes. Till this day i have not faced a single problem with these buds. They get connected quickly, and the sound quality is way too good and unbelievable for the price I got these for.

I was able to further enhance the sound quality by using an equalizer app. If you do not want anc, then these might probably be the best buds for you. And anyways, the buds fit snugly enough that it cancels out most of the environmental sound.

I use these to play Valorant, a game which requires sound to be top notch and also very quick, and these have worked perfectly for me as there is a ""beast mode"" in the buds, which reduces latency.

The ONLY issue I can point in these buds is that the low battery sound is pretty annoying (lol). Rest, I have 0 complaints with it. The buds easily work for like 2 weeks once the case is charged.

Also to note, I use these buds carefully and have only dropped one of the bud once till date. And I've not used them while working out so cannot comment in that context. But other than that, these are PERFECT.","Reviewed in India on 5 January 2025","There's a reason why these are the best sellers","5.0 out of 5 stars","","10","Bold Black"

"R2BUDRR0XIHTFN","Aditya","The boAt Airdopes 141 honestly offer great value for the price. The battery life is the biggest highlight ‚Äî the buds themselves last about 5-6 hours, and with the case, you easily get 30‚Äì35 hours of total playback. That‚Äôs amazing for long travel days or binge-watching sessions.

The sound quality is punchy with decent bass, which is expected from boAt. Vocals and highs are clear, and it‚Äôs great for casual music, calls, and YouTube. Don‚Äôt expect audiophile-level clarity, but for the price, it performs really well.

Call quality is okay ‚Äî the ENx tech helps indoors, though outdoors or in windier places, it can struggle a bit. Touch controls work fine after a little getting used to.

Pros:
‚úÖ Good sound quality for music and videos
‚úÖ No lag while watching videos
‚úÖ Long battery life ‚Äì lasts for hours without frequent charging
‚úÖ Comfortable fit ‚Äì easy to wear for long durations

Cons:
‚ùå Call quality issues ‚Äì The person on the other end struggles to hear me clearly
‚ùå Mic or connectivity problem ‚Äì Sometimes, my voice cuts out during calls

Only sound quality is good.
Durable. They're surving after more than a year when they fall atleast once a week from me.

Cons>>>>
Charging speed is slower after 1 year.
Playback time is way less. Earbuds dircharge and starts beeping after 1.5-2 hours of continuous use. Not for binge watching. Their 6 hours claim is false.
Deserves negative rating for microphone quality and Enx noice cancellation... So bad for taking calls as it hears every outside noise and everything but not my voice when I put them on. Had to switch to microphone for a call. You're not heard using these even at your home with a bit of ceiling fan voice... Forget about outdoors lol. Maybe this functions on reverse noice cancellation.
Big and uncomfortable to carry in a pocket but manageable.
Wireless range is poor. Their 10m range claim is false. It doesn't catches signal sometimes from my pocket too.
Not enough features, only single device connectivity at a time.

If you‚Äôre someone who uses earbuds for long hours then this product is not the comfiest option because it starts to hurt your ears.

On the positive side, the sound quality is good, making them suitable for music and lectures, which was my primary reason for buying them. The design is also comfortable and lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods without feeling painful in the ears.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The voice clarity is just okay, and not exceptional. Additionally, the call quality is not the best, but that wasn't a key factor for me.

Overall, I'd say the Airdopes are a satisfactory choice for anyone looking for a budget-friendly option for listening to music and lectures.

"R33NQYNXEXOVF3","sira","I have used this product for 9 months. I have used this product almost everyday. This product isn't great by any stretch. But for the price I didn't expect it to. I was skeptical from the start. I have used this product with utmost care to see how this product performs and lasts.
Performance: sound quality is passable for the price. I've had trouble with connecting this earbuds but few times as expected (not a big deal for me).
Bulid: Build quality and feel are also passable.
Price: 1499 INR (when I purchased)
Durability: Here is the biggest fault. This pair lasted me for only 9 months. One side stopped working. I have tried several solutions given online (by BoAt and others) but none of them solved the issue.

Verdict: Not worth the money (even compared to xiaomi's sub 500INR wired earphones). I have been using a sub 500INR xiaomi earphones (wired) for more than a year without any issues. I have taken a lot of care so that I do not cause any damage to the earphones. From my experience I would suggest you the consider better earphones (like the sound magic e10c) which are more expensive but are totally worth their price. Or you can choose some cheaper earphones from xiaomi.","Reviewed in India on 16 October 2023","Not worth it","2.0 out of 5 stars","","0","Bold Black"

"RUKXIKO8GYKY","Abhijeet Kumar Singh","Worst delivery service, first. I have the right, as a customer, to see if my goods has been tampered with. The box was damaged with previously opened remarks and its proof is there in the video uploaded. The delivery people repeatedly argue that you should take the package and do whatever you want later, which is just pathetic.

Your delivery guy just said that ""its just 1099 product, whats the big deal. We deliver each day some products of worth 1 lakh. Just take it and go.""

Teach them that, its not easy for everyone to buy and use their money.

Second, a truthful evaluation of this product
Sound quality is descent for everyday use but not for music aficionados.
Noise cancellation ONLY GOOD FOR HOME NOT FOR CROWDED AREAS.
If you are purchasing it for a good base, the bass is actually not the best component.
When the volume is kept above 50%, there is a terrible vocal disturbance; below 30%, it is perfectly normal.

And its a request to amazon, please give some prior knowledge to your delivery partners that its a customers right to open a package and see if its right to buy or not.","Reviewed in India on 26 October 2022","Worst service","2.0 out of 5 stars","","11","Bold Black"

Later I checked for the report from the boAt service centre, it was mentioned it was broken and mentioned earbuds were opened which was never the issue. I was not able to fight and file any complaint as I never had a piece of evidence over this issue as I did not break or open the earbuds before submitting them for servicing.

"R2H1BX07JJNFTF","Shubhangi Singh","The earphones I received are unable to maintain a stable connection even over short physical distances and I often receive distorted noise because of the same, they are not performing as promised by the Bluetooth 5.1 standards advertised by the seller on Amazon. Bluetooth 5.1 promises stronger connection even if a person moves around or there's a wall between the source device and the earphones, but my earphones are unable to maintain connection when I am doing outside exercise or jogging or when I put them in my pocket. It also promises fewer interruptions during music, gaming etc. but my earphones are receiving many interruptions during music listening. It also promises longer range (upto 10 metres) from the source device, but my earphones are unable to maintain connection over this range. I also want to highlight the IPX4 rating advertised by the seller on Amazon. The IPX4 rating means that the device is resistant to mild exposure of sweat which makes sure it is able to operate in circumstances like running and exercise, but my device receives many interruptions and distorted audio in music, when I am engaging in such activities. Audio quality is also very poor and sometimes music stops all by itself. Also, while buying the product displays that it has one- year warranty.

I had high hopes for the boAt Airdopes, but they turned out to be a big letdown.
Battery drains quickly, even after a full charge. Connectivity issues are constant ‚Äî they keep disconnecting randomly during calls and music. The sound quality is average at best, with weak bass and unclear vocals.
Worse, the touch controls are overly sensitive or don‚Äôt work at all. The build feels cheap, and the earbuds don‚Äôt fit securely in the ears despite trying all the tips.

"R3OYM88I9C8JPD","Pavan Punja","If you are brave enough to buy these airpods from BoAt, do spend some time going through this review and it will definitely save you money.

While at first glance, these look economical and extremely good, there is a huge catch with this company as a whole. Upon receiving them, everything seemed to go well until they started to breakdown, one side of the airpods started to emit static noises and soon after stopped working completely.

No problem, there's warranty right? Guess what, they decided to send a refurbished item that was either the exact same product I gave them or another defective piece that wasn't working.

They will mentally torture you, where you'll spend more money on commute and travel to the service center and you'll end up wasting more money than the actual MRP.

In short, don't buy these cheap airpods at whatever cost. They'll eventually fail and you'll regret buying it from a sub-standard company that doesn't care in conducting quality checks when sending under warranty replacements.

Edit - 03/04/2023

Their customer team is equally clueless. They called me at odd times and then proceeded to tell me, that my earpods would be replaced, and finally, told me that they can't do it as it was outside the warranty period.

The airpods that were sent in were completely within warranty. They sent back faulty non-working airpods and right outside the warranty period. They rejected.

The product comes in decent packaging in a box small enough to house a pet mollusc or serve as a congested coffin to a dead rodent. The connection quality is only as good as the connection an average lover of these earbuds can make with a woman. The sheer amount of times my music suddenly stopped and the these cheap excuse of a headphones utters its short curse into my ear which represents ""disconnected"". If by an miracle the ear buds manage to stay consistently connected to a mobile for more than 10 minutes they do not work well. It seems the left and right earbud seems to take turns in playing the music. So many times have I found myself willing to smash the charging box because the sound shifts from one earbud to another in fraction of seconds and killing the vibe of music dead. As written in a useless piece of paper called ""manual"" that comes in the box, putting the headphones back in the box closing it and reconnecting after a few seconds is not helpful. The presence of a section based entirely on troubleshooting connection issues speaks a lot about the amount of attention the makers of this abomination gave to actually fixing the problem.

Though the headphones deliver decent audio quality while they last but bass remains at an all time low, it is not any use since they do not remain connected.
